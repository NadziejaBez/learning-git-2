        <p>
            Is this the real life? 
            Is this just fantasy? 
            Caught in a landslide, no escape from reality. 
            Open your eyes, look up to the skies and see. 
            I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy, 
            Because I'm easy come, easy go, little high, little low.
            Anyway the wind blows 
            Doesn't really matter to me, to me.
